Finch Technical Challenge
=====================

This is a basic setup for the Finch Technical Challenge using React for the front end and Node.js for the back end.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.

### Installing

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/zuhairbhatti/finch.git`
    
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd finch`
    
3.  Install dependencies for both the client and server:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd client npm install  cd ../backend npm install`
    

### Running the Development Servers

1.  Start the React development server:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd client npm run start`
    
    This will start the React app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
    
2.  Start the Node.js development server:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd ../server npm run backend`
    
    This will start the Node.js server. By default, it will run on http://localhost:8000.
